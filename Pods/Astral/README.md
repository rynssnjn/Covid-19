# Astral
Astral is a minimal HTTP Networking library that aims to simplify an application's networking layer by abstracting
the steps needed to create a network request into multiple objects.

It aims to shy away from the typical network layer singleton by encapsulating each part of network request as an object.

Programming.

## Requirements

Astral requires iOS 9.3 or higher and Swift 3.x

## Installation
### [CocoaPods](http://cocoapods.org/)

1. Add the following to your [Podfile](http://guides.cocoapods.org/using/the-podfile.html):

```ruby
pod 'Astral'
```
2. Integrate your dependencies using frameworks: add `use_frameworks!` to your Podfile. 
3. Run `pod install`.

### [Carthage](https://github.com/Carthage/Carthage)

Add the following to your Cartfile:
```
github "hooliooo/Astral"
```

### [Swift Package Manager](https://swift.org/package-manager/)

Add the following  dependency in your Package.swift file:
```
.package(url: "https://github.com/hooliooo/Astral.git", from: "0.9.0")
```

## A Simple Example
Here's an example using the [Pokemon API](http://pokeapi.co) and the implementations of RequestBuilder and RequestDispatcher
provided by Astral.

Feel free to build and customize your own implementations. Simply adopt the appropriate protocols.

```swift
struct PokeAPIConfiguration: RequestConfiguration {

    let scheme: URLScheme = URLScheme.http

    let host: String = "pokeapi.co"

    let basePathComponents: [String] = [
        "api",
        "v2"
    ]

    let baseHeaders: Set<Header> = [
        Header(key: Header.Key.contentType, value: Header.Value.mediaType(MediaType.applicationJSON))
    ]
}
```

```swift
struct PokemonRequest: Request {

    let id: Int

    let configuration: RequestConfiguration = PokeAPIConfiguration()

    let method: HTTPMethod = HTTPMethod.get

    let pathComponents: [String] = [
        "pokemon",
        "\(self.id)"
    ]

    let parameters: Parameters = .none

    let headers: Set<Header> = []
}
```

```swift
let queue: DispatchQueue = DispatchQueue(label: "pokeapi", qos: DispatchQoS.utility, attributes: [DispatchQueue.Attributes.concurrent])

let request: Request = PokemonRequest(id: 1)
let dispatcher: RequestDispatcher = BaseRequestDispatcher(queue: queue)

dispatcher.response(
    of: request,
    onSuccess: { [weak self] (response: Response) -> Void in
        // let responseData: Data = response.data
        // Do something with data
        // or
        // let dictionary: [String: Any] = response.json.dictValue
        // Do something with dictionary
    },
    onFailure: { (error: NetworkingError) -> Void in
        // Handle the error
    },
    onComplete: { () -> Void in
        // Handle the completion of the network request
        // such as clean up of the UI
    }
)
```

## In-depth Example
Let's say you have a get request that requires url path components. An example of that request could be:

```swift
struct YourAPIConfiguration: RequestConfiguration {

    let scheme: URLScheme = URLScheme.https

    let host: String = "yourhost.com"

    let basePathComponents: [String] = [
        "api",
        "v1"
    ]

    let baseHeaders: Set<Header> = [
        Header(key: Header.Key.contentType, value: Header.Value.mediaType(MediaType.applicationJSON))
    ]
}
```

```swift
struct YourRequest: Request {

    let configuration: RequestConfiguration = YourAPIConfiguration()

    let method: HTTPMethod = HTTPMethod.get

    let pathComponents: [String] = [
        "your",
        "path",
        "components"
    ]

    let parameters: Parameters = .dict([
        "yourKey": "yourValue,
        "anotherKey": "anotherValue"
    ])

    let headers: Set<Header> = [
        Header(key: Header.Key.accept, value: Header.Value.mediaType(MediaType.applicationJSON))
    ]
}
```

```swift

let request: Request = YourRequest()
let dispatcher: RequestDispatcher = BaseRequestDispatcher(isDebugMode: true)

dispatcher.urlRequest(of: request).url
```

With these lines of code, your hypothetical request would create the following URL:

```
https://yourhost.com/api/v1/your/path/components?yourKey=yourValue&anotherKey=anotherValue
```

The response would also have the following headers included:
```
Content-Type = application/json
Accept = application/json
```

In the case of when the RequestConfiguration AND the Request have each have a Header with identical keys, the Request WILL OVERWRITE the RequestConfiguration's Header.
